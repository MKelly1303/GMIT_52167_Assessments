Wk1&2_Fib2.py contains the Python scripts used in the Weeks 1 and 2 exercises and the explanation of the ord() function

Wk3_CollatzConjecture.py contains the solution to the exercise in week 3

Wk5_Euler_Prob5.py contains the solution to the Euler Project Problem 5. I'm guessing my code is pretty inefficient for this as it take about 10 mins to run. In case anyone tries to run it, it's not gone into an infinite loop and will output the answer (eventually!).
