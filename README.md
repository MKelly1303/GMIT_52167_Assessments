# GMIT_52167_Assessments

Wk1&2_Fib2.py contains the Python scripts used in the Weeks 1 and 2 exercises and the explanation of the ord() function

Wk3_CollatzConjecture.py contains the solution to the exercise in week 3

Wk5_Euler_Prob5.py contains the solution to the Euler Project Problem 5. I'm guessing my code is pretty inefficient for this as it take about 10 mins to run. In case anyone tries to run it, it's not gone into an infinite loop and will output the answer (eventually!).

Wk6_File_open_and_format.py is the solution to the problem in week 6 (Please complete the following exercise this week. Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns). I tried to format it using a single line, something like print('{0} {1} {2} {3}'.format(line.split (',')[:4])) but I just could not get that working and had to create a string variable to store each value and then print them to screen.
